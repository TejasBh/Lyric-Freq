 -->There's no time for us There's no place for us What is this thing that builds our dreams? Yet slips away from us  Who wants to live forever? Who wants to live forever? Ooh Ooh  There's no chance for us It's all decided for us This world has only one sweet moment Set aside for us  Who wants to live forever? Who wants to live forever? Ooh Ooh Ooh Who dares to love forever? Oh Oh when love must die  Then touch my tears With your lips And touch my world With your fingertips  And we can have forever And we can love forever Forever is our today  Who wants to live forever? Who wants to live forever? Forever is our today Who waits forever anyway?<--
